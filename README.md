JOYPAD

In this projetc i'm using a couple of old harddisk motor to build a new controller generation :) 
In this controller you have 2 rotative encoder (2 old harddisk brushelss motors), an Arduino, and a Bluetooth module.
Using bluetooth it's possible to interface this controller to any Android device (phone, phablet, tables) and to any pc (win/linux, don't know if mac is ok).

It's easy to use, and the idea of this project was born thinking to the Ethc & Sketch interface.
My aim was to build also a ZY plotter and to drive it directly with this interface (like an Etch & Sketch 2.0 ). Maybe it will be ready for the MF.
In the meanwhile, i realized an application for pc and Android that replicates the Etch & Sketch beaviour, and that you can play with using this new Joypad .
I designed also the case of this joypad and print it with my prusa i2.

Source code (for Arduino, Android, PC and 3d .STL) soon!)
